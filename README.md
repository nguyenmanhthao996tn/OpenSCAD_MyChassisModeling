# New Bottom part with crew hole(s)

To measure the antenna in the charmber, the satellite needs to be fixed at least 50cm (according to our simulation) away from the platform. I made 4 different versions for this.

## Changlogs

### Version 1

- Solid metal plaform
- 1 fixing screw in the center of the platform
- Added 4 slots (2mm width) for the RF cables

### Version 2

- The fixing extender to go 2mm further inside the platform to provide the robustnest

### Version 3

- Add another rotational fixing part

### Version 4

**Based on Verion 1**

- There are 4 fixing screw in the center of the platform
